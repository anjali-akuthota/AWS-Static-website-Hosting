# AWS Static Website Hosting Project

**Name:** Akuthota Anjali  
**Training:** Accenture Primer Training  

## 📝 Project Overview
In this project, I created an **Amazon S3 bucket** and configured it for static website hosting.  
I uploaded HTML, CSS, and image files, made them publicly accessible using a bucket policy,  
and distributed the content using **Amazon CloudFront** for faster delivery.

## 🌐 Website URLs
- **S3 Website Endpoint:** [https://<your-bucket-name>.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com  ](http://8357-8118-4507-anjali.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
